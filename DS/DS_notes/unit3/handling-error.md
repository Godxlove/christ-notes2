# how compiler behaves when error happens

![](error_for_line_20.png)

here, a semicolon is missing in line 19.
But the compiler error is in line 20.

#### What to learn from this
- Dont go finding for the error after line 20 only.
- atleast check for errors in the 10 lines before the stated line having the error.
