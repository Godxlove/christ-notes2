Store sign of -ve numbers, each term is similar, we'll follow the desending order (wrt exponent)

#### array representation of polynomials.
Index number of the array is taken as the exponent power.
Eg-
![[polynomials_of_arrays.png]]

<br>

By using arrays to store polynomial numbers, then wastage of space happens if there is a large exponent power and less number of elements are there.

![[why_array_isNot_goodWithPoly.png]]

<br>

Arrays are only good with non-sparse polynomial elements.

### using struct as an array implementation of polynomials

### Addition using struct (polynomials)

# IMPORTANT FOR END SEMS - CASE 1,2,3
#endsems

need more pics for these

![[step1_iteration4_egAddition_struct.png.png.png]]

basically, if one of the two polynomials have exponents greater than the other, it is written down in the resultant polynomial. 


### write more, take pics from ppt
