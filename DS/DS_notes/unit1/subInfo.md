### Types of Data
Data can be divided into 2 parts, i.e, **Atomic** and **Composite**.

Atomic eg - an integer "4034" - breaking it down will make no sense if its a weight of a product.

Composite eg- tlephone number - the country code and the number can be different and still make sense.

### What is a Data Structure?

![[whatisds.png]]

We can even define our own data structures, but with well defined rules.
**note - The DS should be meaningful**

Need of DS is to analyze the data, organizing it in a logical and mathematical manner. (Asked by Mitali)

### ADT - Abstract Data Type

An array is an ADT that holds a collection of elements accessible by an index. 
It's a homogenous type but the elements inside it is heterogenous ,.ie., **primitive** - int, float, char or **complex** - instances of classes.

**always have a menu driven program. The customer should decide to stop the program and not the program itself.**

Yeh karo pehele

![[lab_program1.png]]

alert - check for 1 to (n+1) in the size
COMPLEXITY - chain of elements

![[lab_programEg.png]]

add 2-3 complexities and explain it.

![[lab_programEg2.png]]

keep the 6th option as exit...but keep the user inside the loop untill then.

when searching - ask if they wanna retain the data, dont force them to give the elements again and again.
