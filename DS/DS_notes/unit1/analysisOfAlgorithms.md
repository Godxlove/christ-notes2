#### space complexity varies from program to program.
the var **c** is a constant which doesn't change by OS, machine version.
this is wrt **hardware**.

Best and worse is wrt **data**.
Unsuccessful search -> worst case (wrt search operations)

<br>

### Examples

![](big_o_eg1.png)

When there is a non initialised statement, it is a non operationable statement.

<br>

executable statements --> executables and non-executables.
Frequency --> no. of times a particular statement is executed.
we have (n+1) to accomodate the failed attempted too.

Function call is non executable.

## Time complexity, O(1)

the diff bw the above and below eg is about HOW the INCREMENT is taking place

![](time_complex_Ologn.png)
When a **non-addicitive** constant is there in the increment/decrement part of the loop, then it is O(log n)
