## Notes on CPU scheduling algo

#### FCFS (first come first serve)
reference [video](https://youtu.be/WYo1SpUh9FI) and [this](https://youtu.be/MZdVAVMgNpA)
1. it is a non-preemptive algo.
2. assigns CPU to the first process which comes in (criteria is "arrival time")
3. The process order matter when there are two processes having the same arrival time. (choose the first one which appears in the list)
4. WAITING TIME = RESPONSE TIME (non-preemptive)

Columns to be made -
process no., arrival time, burst time, completion time, turn around time, waiting time, response time

May ask about avg turn around time and avg waiting time.

Read from sir's notes given below and practice them using question from [assignment-async](assignment-async.md). Gayathri's solutions are there to check if you have done it correctly.
