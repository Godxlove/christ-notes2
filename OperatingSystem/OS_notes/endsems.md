## IMPORTANT STUFF

storage management [storage-structure-management](storage-structure-management.md)

comp system architecture  [computer-system_architecture](computer-system_architecture.md) - symmetric vs asymmetric multiprocessing - draw diagrams

user to kernel mode diagram [user-kernel-mode](user-kernel-mode.md)
what CLI is [system-interface](system-interface.md)
system calls [system-calls](system-calls.md)

---

[OS-structure](OS-structure.md)
simple structures - MSDOS
monolithic - UNIX
layered approach

---

[process-state](process-state.md)
what is process state + diagram

<br>

explain PCB [process-control-block](process-control-block.md)

---

process termination - wait() - [process-termination](process-termination.md)

interprocess communication -> message sharing, memory sharing.
