sem 2 notes in Christ

<br>

These are my personal notes. You are free to distribute them and modify them however you want to. But, you may not charge for these notes (make education free!), and due credit is to be given whenever you share them.

You are free to send PRs (Pull Requests) with branches for typos and to add your own notes/pics/mindmaps. If you don't know how to do a PR, then please [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+do+a+pull+request+in+github&oq=how+to+do+a+pull+request+in+github) it.

Almost all the pictures of slides used here belongs to the professors of Christ University, Bangalore. All credits to them for teaching us in a great manner even during online classes. Thanks to my batchmates since I have used their solutions (when the teachers shared them) to many of the questions written in this repo.

Credits to [Codevault](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6qj_bPq6tQ6hLwOBpBQ42Q), [Jenny's Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-yUTYGmrNvKOCcAl21g3w) and many people who have helped me understand the concepts during my semester two. (have to update this credits section)

<br>

## How to use this repo?
1. download this amazing note taking app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). Check out [these](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+use+obsidian) videos to see the features of this tool.
2. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/InfosecGurung/christ-notes2.git`
3. Open Obsidian and you'll be greeted by this menu:

4. Press "open" and then choose the folder you cloned in step 2. The folder's name will be "christ-notes".
5. That's it. You'll then be able to see the notes arranged under each subjects folder. Click on preview button on top right to view the final markdown look of notes (with pics). Image shared below:

## How to update the notes?

2 options are there and doing both is NOT POSSIBLE (XOR options):
- Either you can clone the repo and then start working right away by adding your own notes using markdown. If you dont know what's "markdown", then Google it.
- Or else, you can use `git pull` once you get into the current directory, i.e., christ-notes folder. You can do this thrice in a week.

<br>

## Kindly Note
- This repo is work in major progress. There are not many notes for Stats, English and Maths.
- Feedbacks are welcomed.
- **Do not text/email me on how to use Git and Github**. That is your homework to do.
- If you need help in exploring Obsidian, then press this help/question mark icon available in bottom left of the app.

## What do I have to really study for end sems? (updating it)
This is for me.

### Math

![](readme-pics/Pasted%20image%2020210521012044.png)

focus on unit 1 and 2 first.
Then move to unit 3.

**Unit 1:** Set Theory and Theory of Functions
- [ ] Sets 
- [ ] Set Operations
- [ ] Functions


**Unit 2:** Applications of Functions and Theory of Matrices
- [ ] Sequences and Summations 
- [ ] Cardinality of Sets
- [ ] Matrices


**Unit 3:** Relations
- [ ] Relations and Their Properties
- [ ] Equivalence Relations
- [ ] Partial Orderings

---

### DS

**Section C**
- [ ] prefix, postfix -stack operations
- [ ] Binary tree traversals - inorder, preorder, postorder
- [ ] Sorting the given data using quick/merge/selection sort. Step by step solution.
- [ ] doubly linked list traversal
- [ ] BST - add. delete, modify
- [ ] Circular queue/Linked List operations
- [ ] A complete menu based program based on struct, sorting algo, strings, pointers, sparse matrix.

<br>

**Section B**
- [ ] **Majorly, algo questions have been asked.** 
	- [ ] data structures stack, circular LL, Linked List.
	- [ ] sorting algo
	- [ ] searching algo
	- [ ] BST operations
- [ ] determining the result of recursive function calls.
- [ ] time/space complexity

<br>

Section A is a mix of many units, focus on that later after section B, C.

---

### OS

Check this out: [endsems](OperatingSystem/OS_notes/endsems.md)

**Section C**
- [ ] Gantt charts - scheduling algo for CPU **this question will be there for sure**
- [ ] Explain Scheduling algorithms/ difference between
- [ ] Semaphores : **very important**
	- [ ] are useful in Process Synchronization
	- [ ] Producer consumer problem and explain the solution
	- [ ] dining philosophers problem and explain the solution

- [ ] System calls - may have to write shell scripts/define how it works in different management systems (process control, file management)
- [ ] Explain the different directory structures in Operating Systems.
- [ ] deadlock avoidance - algorithm to prevent it
- [ ] Components of an OS
- [ ] Operations on processes - fork, exec, exit, threads, et al.
- [ ] page tables, page faults

<br>

**Section B**
- [ ] Process Control Block - use/purpose
- [ ] Inter Process Communication - 2 models
- [ ] types of kernels
- [ ] life cycle of a process
- [ ] types of an OS
- [ ] concepts of preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling
- [ ] notes on Segmentation
- [ ] Process Synchronization - its need
- [ ] Peterson's solution to critical section problem
- [ ] Interrupts

B section also has a lot of points to cover and kind of overlaps section C as well.

<br>

A section will have mixed types from all units, will focus on it last.

### Stats

I have no idea how to go on with Stats :/

![](readme-pics/Pasted%20image%2020210521013042.png)

<br>

**Section C - all topics mentioned here are very important and will be in endsems**
- [ ] Karl Pearson’s and Spearman’s rank coefficient of correlation
- [ ] develop the equation of a regression line
- [ ] some probability questions wrt standard deviation
- [ ] null hypothesis - *significance level/ alpha* 
- [ ] mean, median, mode, variance, correlation

<br>

**Section B**
- [ ] confidence level - IMPORTANT (check out which unit it is)
- [ ] PROBABILITY QUESTIONS MAX ASKED - Binomial, Poisson and normal distribution
- [ ] obtain the correlation coefficient
- [ ] some questions had words like "significance leve/ alpha"

<br>

**Section A** - asks about formulas, definitions. Will prepare in the end.

### English
yet to plan.
