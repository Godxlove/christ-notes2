These are my personal notes. You are free to distribute them and modify them however you want to. But, you may not charge for these notes (make education free!), and due credit is to be given whenever you share them.

You are free to send PRs (Pull Requests) with branches for typos and to add your own notes/pics/mindmaps. If you don't know how to do a PR, then please [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+do+a+pull+request+in+github&oq=how+to+do+a+pull+request+in+github) it.

Almost all the pictures of slides used here belongs to the professors of Christ University, Bangalore. All credits to them for teaching us in a great manner even during online classes. Thanks to my batchmates since I have used their solutions (when the teachers shared them) to many of the questions written in this repo.

Credits to [Codevault](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6qj_bPq6tQ6hLwOBpBQ42Q), [Jenny's Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-yUTYGmrNvKOCcAl21g3w) and many people who have helped me understand the concepts during my semester two. (have to update this credits section)

## How to update the notes?

2 options are there and doing both is NOT POSSIBLE (XOR options):
- Either you can clone the repo and then start working right away by adding your own notes using markdown. If you dont know what's "markdown", then Google it.
- Or else, you can use `git pull` once you get into the current directory, i.e., christ-notes folder. You can do this thrice in a week.

## Kindly Note
- This repo is work in major progress. There are not many notes for Stats, English and Maths.
- Feedbacks are welcomed.
- **Do not text/email me on how to use Git and Github**. That is your homework to do.
- If you need help in exploring Obsidian, then press this help/question mark icon available in bottom left of the app.
