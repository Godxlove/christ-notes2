`Dear Daniel` works since in the foreign countries, everyone is treated with respect, no sir/ma'am. But you can still use it.

Also, `Respected sir` itself has two words of respect, can use only `sir`.


`Yours sincerely/faithfully` can be used in all letters.
not `Your's`, it is `Yours`.

<br>

`Thanking you` and `I thank you` works - comes after the body of the letter.
